# Baby Cry Analyzer Mobile Application

A cutting-edge React Native application designed to help parents understand and respond to their infants' needs through advanced audio analysis and machine learning.

## Project Overview

The Baby Cry Analyzer is an innovative mobile application that provides real-time analysis of infant cries to help parents and caregivers better understand their babies' needs. Using advanced audio processing and machine learning algorithms, the app delivers immediate insights and recommendations.

### Key Features
- Real-time cry analysis and classification
- Historical pattern tracking and visualization
- Personalized baby care recommendations
- Community and expert support integration
- Secure data management
- Cross-platform support (iOS/Android)

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- Node.js 18+
- React Native CLI
- Xcode 14+ (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- VS Code (recommended IDE)

### Platform-specific Requirements

#### iOS
- macOS with latest Xcode
- CocoaPods
- iOS 14.0+ deployment target

#### Android
- Android Studio
- JDK 11
- Android SDK 31+
- Android 10.0+ deployment target

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd baby-cry-analyzer
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install iOS dependencies
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

4. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```

5. Run the application
```bash
# For iOS
npm run ios

# For Android
npm run android
```

## Development Guidelines

### TypeScript Usage
- Strict type checking enabled
- Interface-first approach for component props
- Comprehensive type definitions for API responses
- Strict null checks enforced

### State Management
- Redux Toolkit for global state
- Context API for component-level state
- Persistence with Redux Persist
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Audio Processing Implementation
- Real-time audio capture using `react-native-audio-recorder-player@3.5.0`
- Background audio processing with `@react-native-community/audio-toolkit@2.0.3`
- Efficient memory management for continuous recording
- Noise cancellation and audio filtering

### Data Flow
1. Audio Capture → Processing → Analysis
2. Pattern Recognition → Classification → Recommendations
3. User Interface → State Management → API Integration

## Testing

### Unit Testing
```bash
npm test
```

### E2E Testing
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Critical paths require 100% coverage
- Audio processing modules require integration tests

## Performance

### Optimization Guidelines
- Use React.memo for pure components
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimize audio processing with WebAssembly
- Implement efficient caching strategies

## Security

### Best Practices
- Secure storage for sensitive data
- API key encryption
- Audio data privacy controls
- User data protection compliance

## Deployment

### iOS Release
```bash
npm run build:ios
```

### Android Release
```bash
npm run build:android
```
